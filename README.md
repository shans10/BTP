# BTP

This is a simple pathtracer written in C++ as part of our B.Tech. CSE Final Year Project.

## Building and Running

`$ cmake -B build`

`$ cmake --build build`


On Windows, you can build either `debug` (the default) or `release` (the optimized version). To specify this, use the `--config <debug|release>` option.
